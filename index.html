<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
<img src="assets/images/ourstory/story.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>
Our story began quietly with a picture and a simple request for a number. Andrew reached out, introductions were made, and just like that… everything began.

From the very first chat, something felt different. Our conversations flowed easily, with comfort in our words, laughter in our messages, and honesty in the way we spoke. From the beginning, Andrew was sincere and clear about his intentions and intentional about building a future together.
</p>
</p>
Our love story began at a distance. We built our connection through late night conversations, long messages, and prayers. For about 5 months, we built a connection without touch or sight, just trust, patience, and intention. When we finally met in person, it felt like our hearts already knew what our eyes were just discovering. The connection became even more real, the love deepened, and everything we had nurtured from a distance made sense. We knew this wasn’t just attraction or chance, this was something God had been preparing.
</p>
</p>
Our journey has not been perfect. We have had challenges and moments that tested our patience and faith. But through every stage, God has been our anchor and taught us how to forgive, grow, and choose each other. From there, the thought of spending our lives together felt right. It felt peaceful. It felt like home.
</p>
</p>
Today, we are more than two people in love. We are best friends, partners, and each other’s safe place. We pray together, laugh together, grow together, and walk forward with love and faith leading the way. What began with a simple message has become a lifetime promise. What started as distance has become closeness. What started as friendship has become forever. And now, as we step into this new chapter as husband and wife, we do so with grateful hearts, thankful for where we started, proud of how far we’ve come, and excited for the life we are building together, with love and God at the center of it all.

<h2>PHOTOBOOK</h2>

<p>
Every picture tells a story, every moment a memory. Step into our journey of love, laughter, and forever.
<br><br>
As you scroll through these memories, you're not just viewing our past — you're witnessing the foundation of our forever. You're seeing the grace that brought us together, the faith that keeps us grounded, and the love that makes us brave enough to say "yes" to a lifetime. These are the moments we'll tell our children about. These are the memories that will carry us through every season ahead.
<br><br>
Thank you for being part of our story. Open the photo book and walk with us through the beautiful, messy, grace-filled journey that led us to July 11, 2026.
