<h2>PHOTOBOOK</h2>

<p class="photobook-text">
Every picture tells a story, every moment a memory. Step into our journey of love, laughter, and forever.
As you scroll through these memories, you're not just viewing our past - you're witnessing the foundation of our forever. You're seeing the grace that brought us together, the faith that keeps us grounded, and the love that makes us brave enough to say "yes" to a lifetime. These are the moments we'll tell our children about.
These are the memories that will carry us through every season ahead.
Thank you for being part of our story. Open the photo book and walk with us through the beautiful, messy, grace-filled journey that led us to July 11, 2026.

<h4>WHAT'S THE DRESS CODE FOR GUESTS?</h4>
<p>We'd love all our guests to wear the selected Aso Ebi. We'll send purchase info for Aso Ebi very soon!</p>

<h4>I'M COMING FROM OUTSIDE OGBOMOSO/NIGERIA - WHAT SHOULD I KNOW?</h4>
<p>We're so honoured! Please plan your travel and accommodation early. Ogbomoso is a vibrant busy city, so arriving a day or two before is highly recommended. We'll share helpful travel tips and a guide closer to the date.</p>

<h4>WHAT TIME SHOULD I ARRIVE?</h4>
<p>We kindly ask that guests arrive 30 minutes early for each event to help us stay on schedule — especially for the Nikkah at 9:00 AM sharp.</p>

<h4>CAN I BRING A GIFT?</h4>
<p>Your presence is the best gift! But for those who wish to bless us further, we'll share our wedding registry and cash gift details soon.</p>

<h4>CAN I TAKE PHOTOS OR VIDEOS?</h4>
<p>Absolutely — just respectfully! We'll have professional photographers covering the day, but feel free to capture memories.</p>

<h4>ARE CHILDREN ALLOWED?</h4>
<p>Yes, kids are welcome! Please let us know in your RSVP how many you'll bring so we can plan accordingly.</p>

<h4>WHAT'S THE AFTER PARTY LIKE?</h4>
<p>Laid-back vibes with music, dancing, and fun till late. No strict dress code — come in glam or comfy partywear, but come ready to dance!</p>
