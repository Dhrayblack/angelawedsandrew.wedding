A love rooted in faith, friendship, and grace. From the first shy hello to the confident "yes," we've grown together through laughter, tears, and countless ordinary days made extraordinary by each other's presence. We can't wait to celebrate with you as we begin this next chapter.

<h2>PHOTOBOOK</h2>

<p>
Every picture tells a story, every moment a memory. Step into our journey of love, laughter, and forever.
<br><br>
As you scroll through these memories, you're not just viewing our past — you're witnessing the foundation of our forever. You're seeing the grace that brought us together, the faith that keeps us grounded, and the love that makes us brave enough to say "yes" to a lifetime. These are the moments we'll tell our children about. These are the memories that will carry us through every season ahead.
<br><br>
Thank you for being part of our story. Open the photo book and walk with us through the beautiful, messy, grace-filled journey that led us to July 11, 2026.
