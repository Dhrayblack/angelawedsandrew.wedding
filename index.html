<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
<img src="assets/images/ourstory/story.jpg" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>Our story began with a picture and a request for Angela's number. Andrew texted on April 3, 2020, and from that first message, everything changed. Our conversations flowed easily, filled with laughter, honesty, and comfort. From the beginning, he was sincere and clear about his intentions to build a future together.</p>

</p>Our love started at a distance. For about four months, we built our connection through late night calls, long messages, and prayers, without meeting in person. We were always on video call, sending each other pictures and short videos of our daily lives just so it felt like we were together. When we finally met, it felt natural, as if our hearts already knew each other. We knew this was more than chance, it was something God had prepared.</p>

</p>Even while apart, we learned how to communicate, support each other, and grow together. Distance taught us patience, trust, and the value of choosing each other every day, even when it wasn’t easy. Those early months built a strong foundation for everything that followed.</p>

</p>Our journey has not been perfect, but God has been our anchor, teaching us how to forgive, grow, and choose each other. Today, we are best friends and partners, walking forward in love and faith. What began with a simple message has become a lifetime promise, and now we step into marriage with grateful hearts and God at the center of it all.<p>

<h2>FROM OUR HEARTS</h2>

<h3>Angela</h3>
<p>I remember him telling me he loved me just a few days after we met, and at first I thought, we just met! But he said, “A man with dreams needs a woman who believes in him,” and in that moment, I saw his heart, his sincerity, and his vision for us.</p>
</p>Through distance, through growth, through every lesson God walked us through, you remained consistent. Loving you feels intentional, and i'm grateful for your leadership, and the way you choose me daily. I can’t wait to build forever with you.</p>

<h3>Andrew</h3>
<p>From the moment we connected, I knew this was different. What began with a picture and a number became a love that changed my life. Your patience and faith have shaped me beautifully.</p>

</p>You are my safe place, my best friend, the woman I prayed for. Loving you feels peaceful, it feels like home. I’m honored to walk this life with you, hand in hand, guided by God.</p>
